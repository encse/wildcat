# Four Ball Synchronous Half Shower

![FourBallSynchronousHalfShower](/videos/mp4/fourwimpy.mp4)

Throw two balls at a time so they cross at the top. It's important to make sure one always goes over the other. If you can do [Rainbow Cross](rainbowcross) with three balls, then this shouldn't be too hard.
