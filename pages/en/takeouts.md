# Take Outs

![TakeOuts](/resources/videos/poster/takeouts.jpg)

I didn't think too much about this one as I was learning it. Start doing a [Cascade](cascade.md), then reach over, grab a ball and carry it up and around the outside of the pattern. Your other hand will probably naturally do
 [Two in One Hand - Columns](twoinonehand-columns.md) while you complete the carry. As your arm comes around, you throw under your arm and continue the pattern. It's really easier than it looks. Don't think too much and just do it.
