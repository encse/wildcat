# Behind the Back Start

![BehindTheBackStart](/resources/videos/poster/behindthebackstart.jpg)

Throw all three balls behind your back. I throw the one near my fingertips the highest. Claw the bottom two and start juggling. It would be best to try throwing all three up in front of you and start juggling before you try behind your back.
