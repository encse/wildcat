# Over the Top

![OverTheTop](/videos/mp4/overthetop.mp4)

Over the Top is exactly what it sounds like. Juggle in a normal [Cascade](cascade), then just throw one ball over the top of the other balls instead of underneath. The timing of the throw is the same as all other throws. It looks best if you move your hand outward slightly to make the throw more horizontal.
