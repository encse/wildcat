Tennis is a variation of [Over the Top](overthetop.md). Start by throwing one ball over the top. That ball is caught by the other hand and thrown back over the top in the other direction. This trick looks best if you move your hand outward slightly before throwing over the top. This causes the ball to be thrown more horizontally.
