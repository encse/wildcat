# Chops

![Chops](/resources/videos/poster/chops.jpg)

This is a variation of the [Cascade](cascade.md). Start by grabbing one ball at the top of its path. Then quickly move your hand downward between the other two balls. The throw will be a normal [Cascade](cascade.md) throw. At first you may want to just do one chop with one hand and work your way up to continuous chops.
