# Club

![ClubHalfShower](/videos/mp4/clubhalfshower.mp4)

Before learning to do a Half Shower, you should learn to throw one club [Over the Top](cluboverthetop). Once you've got that mastered, then just throw every club over the top continuously. When I throw the club over the top, I let the club slide through my hand until I'm holding onto the knob and throw it from there.
