# Inverted Shower

You pretty much do what you see here. It's easier if you grab the balls from the top, but you'll block your audience's view of the ball. I find this trick very difficult. I tend to bump the ball with my wrist as I'm carring across the top. If you like the look of this trick, but find it too difficult, try the [Pendulum](pendulum) instead.
