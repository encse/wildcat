# Four Ball Synchronous Fountain

![FourBallSynchronousFountain](/resources/videos/poster/foursynchronous.jpg)

Before learning four balls, you need to learn [Two in One Hand - Outside](twoinonehand-outside.md) in both your right and left hands. In this pattern, you throw them from both hands simultaneously. That's really all there is to it. Notice that the balls never switch hands.
