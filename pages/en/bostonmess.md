# Boston Mess

![BostonMess](/resources/videos/poster/bostonmess.jpg)

This trick is also know as the Half Boston Mess. One arm always stays on top, when the arm on top alternates in each succession of throws this trick is called the [Full Boston Mess](http://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Boston_mess). That hand throws each ball straight up in succession and then starts over with the first ball.
