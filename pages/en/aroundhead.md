# Around Head

![AroundHead](/resources/videos/poster/aroundhead.jpg)

This pattern is a lot like the [Pendulum](pendulum.md). Do [Two in One Hand - Outside](twoinonehand-outside.md). Every time the ball finishes circling your head, drop it into the pattern and grab the ball from the two in one hand as it peaks.
