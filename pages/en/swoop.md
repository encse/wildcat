# Swoop

![Swoop](/videos/mp4/swoop.mp4)

Start juggling [Two in One Hand - Columns](twoinonehand-columns). Hold one ball in your other hand at the top of the pattern on the other side of your body. As the outside column ball peaks, drop the ball you were holding and [Claw](clawing) the peaking ball. Notice that the middle ball just keeps going up and down. The outside balls get clawed, carried underneath, and thrown straight up again. It's easier to just do it than to think about it too much.
