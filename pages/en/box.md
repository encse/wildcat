# Box

![Box](/resources/videos/poster/box.jpg)

For the Box, two balls go up and down in columns and the other gets thrown straight across the bottom. I have a tendency to hand the ball back and forth across the bottom which doesn't look good at all. Practice throwing it straight across the bottom.
