# Tricks

Wildcat Jugglers were a group of students who met once a week to juggle. The club met at Thunder Bay Junior High in Alpena, Michigan.

This tutorial is designed to teach beginning to intermediate juggling patterns.

For better written descriptions of these tricks, I highly recommend Jon Relf's [TWJC Tutorials](http://www.twjc.co.uk/tutorials.html). There you will find well thought out written descriptions of many more tricks than I have listed here. I also recommend buying
[Charlie Dancey's Encyclopedia of Ball Juggling](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/969254.Charlie_Dancey_s_Encyclopaedia_of_Ball_Juggling). It's fun to read and has great illustrations.

## First steps

Let's see how to become a jugglerâ€¦

-  [Learning the Cascade](#/en/learningthecascade)

## Two in One Hand

These are nice tricks on their own. They also give the basis for the more complicated patterns with 3 or more balls.
