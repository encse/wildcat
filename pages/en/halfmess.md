Start with a [Reverse Cascade](reversecascade). Now throw one [Under Your Arm](underthearm) and catch the next [Under Your Arm](underthearm). Then go back to the [Reverse Cascade](reversecascade), making sure that you do the throw [Over the Top](overthetop) (as all the throws are in a [reverse cascade](reversecascade)). Immediately repeat this pattern.
