# Shower

This is the pattern most people try to learn on their own before they know how to juggle. This is not a good beginning pattern to learn. Beginners should always learn the [Cascade](cascade.md). The Shower is much faster. Start with two balls in one hand and one in the other. Throw both balls from one hand in rapid succession. After both balls from the first hand are in the air, throw the third ball across the bottom. Just keep it going from here!
