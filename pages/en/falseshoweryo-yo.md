# False Shower Yo-Yo

![FalseShowerYo-Yo](/videos/mp4/falseshoweryoyo.mp4)

I don't know what the name of this pattern is, but it's one of my favorites. It's the same as the [False Shower](falseshower) except that one hand is turned over, raised, and follows the ball under it like the [Yo-Yo](yo-yo) pattern.
