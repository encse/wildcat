<p>Before learning this trick, I suggest that you learn to <a href="One-upTwo-up.htm">One-up Two-up</a>. <a href="One-upTwo-up.htm">One-up Two-up</a> is basically the same trick, but it's easier because you don't have to worry about how high you throw the balls as much, therefore there are fewer accidental collisions. Juggle <a href="TwoInOneHand-Columns.htm">Two Balls in One Hand - Columns</a>. The other hand carries a ball in over the top of the inside ball. Try to follow it as exactly as possible. It should look like the bottom ball is attached to the top by a string.</p>
