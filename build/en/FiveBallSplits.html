</p>
<p>This is a really easy five ball pattern. You can start working on it as soon as you've learned the <a href="Cascade.html">Three Ball Cascade</a>. Start with three balls in one hand. Throw one to the other hand just as you would if you were juggling a <a href="Cascade.html">Cascade</a>. Then throw the other two balls from the other hand so that they split, sending one ball to the other hand and one ball sort of straight up just to be caught back in the same hand that threw it. The next throw is done the same way, but goes in between the other two balls in the air. The trick feels just like a <a href="Cascade.html">Three Ball Cascade</a>.</p>
<p>When you throw two balls from one hand at the same time it's called a multiplex.</p>
