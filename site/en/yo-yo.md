# Yo-Yo

Before learning this trick, I suggest that you learn to [One-up Two-up](one-uptwo-up.md). [One-up Two-up](one-uptwo-up.md) is basically the same trick, but it's easier because you don't have to worry about how high you throw the balls as much, therefore there are fewer accidental collisions. Juggle [Two Balls in One Hand - Columns](twoinonehand-columns.md). The other hand carries a ball in over the top of the inside ball. Try to follow it as exactly as possible. It should look like the bottom ball is attached to the top by a string.
