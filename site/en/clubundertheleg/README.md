![Club Under The Leg](site/videos/poster/clubunderleg.jpg)

Throwing a club under your leg is just as easy as throwing a ball [Under the Leg](site/en/undertheleg/README.md). As soon as you catch the club that you're going to throw under your leg, start moving for your leg right away. Don't wait until it's time to throw and then reach for your leg. If you have trouble reaching under your leg, you may want to let the club slide through your hand so that you're holding it by the knob. This will give you a little more reach.
