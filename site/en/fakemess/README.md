# Fake Mess

![FakeMess](/site/videos/poster/fakemess.jpg)

Believe it or not, this is very closely related to the trick called [Right Middle Left](/site/en/rightmiddleleft/README.md). Do [Right Middle Left](/site/en/rightmiddleleft/README.md) and notice that one hand is just sitting there doing nothing at times during the trick. All you do is carry that ball under your other arm (don't let go!) and then carry it back in time for its next throw. Do that every time. Make the pattern sway back and forth a little to make it look more like [Mill's Mess](/site/en/millsmess/README.md).
