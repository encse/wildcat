Start with a [Reverse Cascade](/site/en/reversecascade/README.md). Now throw one [Under Your Arm](/site/en/underthearm/README.md) and catch the next [Under Your Arm](/site/en/underthearm/README.md). Then go back to the [Reverse Cascade](/site/en/reversecascade/README.md), making sure that you do the throw [Over the Top](/site/en/overthetop/README.md) as all the throws are in a [reverse cascade](/site/en/reversecascade/README.md). Immediately repeat this pattern.
