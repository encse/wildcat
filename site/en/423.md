I named this by its siteswap name. Check for tutorials on the internet, if you don't know what [Siteswaps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siteswap) are. the throwing pattern of this is the same as several tricks with different names. by throwing the balls in the same order, but changing the path they follow, you can make some tricks that look completely different from this one. check out [right, middle, left](rightmiddleleft.md), [w](w.md), [take outs](takeouts.md), and [fake mess](fakemess.md) for some other tricks with the siteswap 423.
