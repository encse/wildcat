# False Shower Yo-Yo

![FalseShowerYo-Yo](/site/videos/poster/falseshoweryoyo.jpg)

I don't know what the name of this pattern is, but it's one of my favorites. It's the same as the [False Shower](/site/en/falseshower/README.md) except that one hand is turned over, raised, and follows the ball under it like the [Yo-Yo](/site/en/yo-yo/README.md) pattern.
