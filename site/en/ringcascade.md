# Ring Cascade

![RingCascade](/site/videos/poster/ringcascade.jpg)

To juggle rings, you release them a with your hands held a little higher, and you catch them with your hands higher. Other than that, it's just as easy as juggling balls. If you're juggling rings for an audience, you'll want to stand sideways so that they can see the rings. Otherwise, they practically disappear.
