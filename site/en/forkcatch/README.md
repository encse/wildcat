The Fork Catch is a way to catch a ball on the back of your hand. You can do this by spreading you index and middle fingers apart and letting the ball rest in between. Another method is to catch the ball on your index and ring fingers by holding your middle finger lower, which is the method I used in this video. As you catch the ball, start with your hand a little high and lower it to absorb the shock of the ball hitting. The idea is to prevent the ball from bouncing.
