# Pendulum

Do [Two in One Hand - Outside](/site/en/twoinonehand-outside/README.md) first. Hold the third ball in your other 
hand with your elbow in the air as in the video. Practice swinging this arm back and forth in sync 
with the other balls. When you get the rhythm right, let go of the ball in the pendulum hand just as 
the other ball is peaking. As your hand swings back out, catch the ball that was peaking.
