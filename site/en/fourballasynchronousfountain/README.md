Before learning four balls, you need to learn [Two in One Hand - Outside](site/en/twoinonehand-outside/README.md) in both your right and left hands. In this pattern, you throw from one hand first. When that ball reaches its peak, you throw from the other hand. Then it's just the same as doing two in one hand, only you're doing it with both hands. Notice that the balls never switch hands.
