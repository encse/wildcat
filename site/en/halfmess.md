Start with a [Reverse Cascade](reversecascade.md). Now throw one [Under Your Arm](underthearm.md) and catch the next [Under Your Arm](underthearm.md). Then go back to the [Reverse Cascade](reversecascade.md), making sure that you do the throw [Over the Top](overthetop.md) (as all the throws are in a [reverse cascade](reversecascade.md)). Immediately repeat this pattern.
