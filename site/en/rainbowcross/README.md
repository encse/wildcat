Rainbow Cross is a simple variation of [One-up Two-up](/site/en/one-uptwo-up/README.md). Instead of throwing the two outside balls straight up, cross them so that you catch them in opposite hands. The only problem is there is a potential for collisions. I always throw the ball from my right hand over the ball from my left hand. Another method is to throw one ball in front of the other.
