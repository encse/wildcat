When you do a Flash, throw all three balls in quick succession. All the balls should be in the air at the same time. You may want to clap your hands together while all balls are in the air to convince yourself that they're all up there. This is the first step in learning to juggle [Five Balls](site/en/fiveballcascade/README.md). When juggling five the Flash would be the first three throws, then you just throw up another to replace each ball as it comes down.
