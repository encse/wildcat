# Real Tennis

![RealTennis](/site/videos/poster/realtennis.jpg)

In this version of [Tennis](tennis.md), the middle two balls go straight up and down, so they look more like a real tennis net. It's a variation of [Right Middle Left](rightmiddleleft.md). Start with the hand holding two balls. Throw one ball straight up the middle, and throw the next ball from the same hand [Over the Top](overthetop.md). While that ball is in the air, throw the ball from the other hand straight up. Catch the over the top ball and immediately throw it over the top in the other direction.
