# Overhead Cascade

![OverheadCascade](/site/videos/poster/overheadcascade.jpg)

This is the same as the [Cascade](/site/en/cascade/README.md), only done over your head. I first learned this while lying on my back on the floor. It feels like you're pushing the balls up instead of the way normal juggling throws feel. The trick feels exactly the same to me when I do it over my head or on my back.
