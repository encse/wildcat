![Behind the Back Catch](site/videos/poster/behindthebackcatch.jpg)

Practice catching a ball behind your back without juggling. It's not as hard as it might look. Just as you don't look at your hands when you juggle any other pattern, you don't need to see your hand to catch behind your back. Watch the ball as long as you can before it goes out of sight behind your back. If you see it peak, your hand will know where it's going to land.
