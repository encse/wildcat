To do One-up Two-up, do [Two in One Hand - Columns](/site/en/twoinonehand-columns/README.md), then just throw the other ball up and down by itself in the other hand. You can also switch the hand that catches the middle ball every time if you want to. After learning this trick, you may want to learn these variations: [One-up Two-up Tennis](/site/en/one-uptwo-uptennis/README.md), [One-up Two-up Hops](/site/en/one-uptwo-uphops/README.md), and [Rainbow Cross](/site/en/rainbowcross/README.md).
