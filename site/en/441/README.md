441 is a siteswap name. Check for tutorials on the internet, if you don't know what [Siteswaps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siteswap) are. to do this, you just do [two in one hand - outside](/site/en/twoinonehand-outside/README.md) for two throws, then fire one across the bottom to the other hand. do two in one hand there and throw that one across the bottom again. the bottom throw is the same throw that's used in the [box](/site/en/box/README.md) or the [shower](/site/en/shower/README.md).
