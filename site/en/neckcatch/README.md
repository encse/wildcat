![Neck Catch](/site/videos/poster/neckcatch.jpg)

Toss a ball a little higher than usual. Watch the ball go up, then back down and at the last possible second, bend down to catch it on your neck. The key is to watch the ball as long as possible. I don't like the way my arms look in this video, but you have to tip your head back and your shoulders up to make a spot for the ball to land without rolling out. This is easier to do with bean bags at first.
