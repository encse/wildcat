# Around Head

![AroundHead](/site/videos/poster/aroundhead.jpg)

This pattern is a lot like the [Pendulum](/site/en/pendulum/README.md). Do [Two in One Hand - Outside](/site/en/twoinonehand-outside/README.md). Every time the ball finishes circling your head, drop it into the pattern and grab the ball from the two in one hand as it peaks.
